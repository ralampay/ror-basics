# Installation and Setup

## Setting Up a Ruby Version Manager with `rvm`

A Ruby Version Manager is a program that sets up multiple versions of Ruby in your system allowing you to switch versions between projects. In this case we will be using `rvm`.

### Mac OS X or Linux

Install `rvm` via: [https://rvm.io/](https://rvm.io/)

### Windows

We can install `rvm` via [https://github.com/magynhard/rvm-windows](https://github.com/magynhard/rvm-windows) which will require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en).

Another option would be to install `WSL2` or [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) which basically allows you to install `rvm` the normal way (see `Mac OS X or Linux` section)
